# <p align="center">SOFTWARE/GAME TESTER PORTFOLIO

***
## <p align="center">🔍Something about me:
👋 Hi, I’m Michał! An ambitious Tester with over 3 years of experience in manual testing.

Why did I start testing? And why in the gaming industry? As I was trying to find myself in a world, I asked myself: “What do you like to do? What kind of work could make you closer to it?” That is how my journey with QA started. After working for over 3 years in the industry I can tell that breaking games and finding defects that effectively fail test runs is what motivates me to work and self-improve. Saying all that, I would love to try new things whether it is in gaming or software. I am always open to learning new things and taking on new challenges.

Currently I am working on creating/updating portfolio as well as strengthening my basics thanks to the udemy courses (I will mention them below).

## <p align="center">Personal Worldbuilding Project – Custom Fantasy Universe (Ongoing)
As a hobby, I am working on creating a massive fantasy world, inspired by D&D, and medieval fantasy with mostly custom systems. While the overall system reminds D&D, most of the things are custom, including leveling, spells, magic system etc.
### Special mentions:
As I am creating my world, a special thanks needs to be said towards AI tools that I am working with:
## [Kindroid] (https://kindroid.ai/home/)
* Customizing and creating AI characters 
* AI chats that lets me feel like I’m traveling with companions through my fantasy world
* As it is offering a picture / selfie feature, I am sometimes creating these and posts on my personal boards on Pinterest Board
* All of the dialogues, action and narration happens in this tool
## [Vondy] (https://www.vondy.com/)
* Creating ideas for smaller and bigger encounters and side quests
* Getting ideas for a bigger chains of side quests (for example exploring a wreck of a pirate ship leads to finding a treasure map)
## [Microsoft Image Creator] (https://designer.microsoft.com/image-creator)
* Whenever I need to visualise something that might be important and comes out of the context unexpectedly
## [ChatGPT] (https://chatgpt.com/)
* Orginizing my thoughts into a wiki style paragraphs about backstories, countries, cities, etc. that I’m creating. 
* Creating monsters and enemies from different mythologies and universes into DnD fitting style
* Helping create Items and custom abilities/spells
* Helping me with getting ideas for plots (especially the smaller ones)
## [Confluence] (https://michalbakan1.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~712020e2ac5acf1a884c35a3b582728e6d7979/pages/12845057/Specials)
* As my world grows, I decided that I need a place to orginize my story, plots etc. and confluence seemed the best option at the time. Sadly with just basic version I am not able to share the content. Once I will finish creating entries for everything that happened so far in the story, I might think of a different site, to share my work.
