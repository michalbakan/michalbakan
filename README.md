- 👋 Hi, I’m Michał Bakan! An abitious Game Tester with almost 3 years of experiance in outsource testing.

## Something about me:
- Why testing games? As I was trying to find myself in a world, I asked myself: “What do you like to do? What kind of work could make you closer to it?” That is how my journey with QA started. 
After working for almost 3 years in the industry I can tell that breaking games and finding defects that effectively fail test runs is what motivates me to do the work. 
Sadly outsource has no more mysteries for me as a regular manual tester, hence why I would love to try new things whether it is gaming or soft industry, I am open to learn new things and new challenges.

- Currently working on creating a portfolio as well as strengthening my basics thanks to the udemy courses (I will mention them below). Next step will be learning REST API (so basics of HTTP, XML, and JSON) and trying to add some practical, things containing that knowledge to the portfolio. In the future I also plan on learing SQL and gain basic knowledge of creating the websites.
