- 👋 Hi, I’m Michał Bakan! An abitious Game Tester with almost 3 years of experiance in outsource testing.

- Why testing games? As I was trying to find myself in a world, I asked myself: “What do you like to do? What kind of work could make you closer to it?” That is how my journey with QA started. 
After working for almost 3 years in the industry I can tell that breaking games and finding defects that effectively fail test runs is what motivates me to do the work. 
Sadly outsource has no more mysteries for me as a regular manual tester, hence why I would love to try new things whether it is gaming or soft industry I am open to learn new things and new challenges.
