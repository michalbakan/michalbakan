# <p align="center"> SOFTWARE / GAME TESTER PORTFOLIO

##  <p align="center"> About Me

👋 Hi, I’m **Michał!**  
An ambitious **Manual Tester** with over **3 years of experience** in QA and a strong passion for games and software quality.

### Why Testing? Why Games?

As I was trying to find my path, I asked myself:  
> “What do you like to do? What kind of work could bring you closer to it?”

That’s how my QA journey began.  
After 3+ years in the industry, I’ve learned that **breaking games**, **finding defects**, and **improving quality** is what truly motivates me.  

I’m always open to **new challenges**, eager to **learn new tools**, and ready to grow — both in **game** and **software testing**.
